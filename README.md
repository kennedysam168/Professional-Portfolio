# <Sam-Kennedys-Professional-Portfolio>

## Description
This is my portfolio to be used to display my projects as I create them throughout the course. It is also itself a way to showcase my coding knowledge and skills. Through this project I strengthened my understanding of some concepts in CSS as well as learning knew ones like @font-face.

## Installation
I began this project by creating a index.html and style.css file. I then proceeded by opening a base HTML outline and figuring out what semantic elements I would use. Once I created the semantic elements I then figured out what words and names i wanted to use. Once I found the words to use I went and started the simple CSS steps of background color and sizing for all the different elements. From there I moved the headings around to make them centered and made sure that everything was where i wanted it to be on the page. Next I used the @font-face element to add a custom font to the text. I then inserted the images and adjusted their sizing to fit my liking and typed the content for the About Me and Contact sections. From there I researched and started playing around with animations and landed on having a fade in element and incorperated that. Finally I added a hover element to the navigation bar and linked the different sections of the page to the nav bar to make it responsive.

## Instructions
To navigate the webpage you can use the navigation links that are underlined in the center of the opening page, or you can scroll down to see everything.
